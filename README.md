Collectd Cgroups
================

Yet another cgroups plugin for collectd.

You can hide cgroups with patterns, and later, monitoring memory.

There is an official Cgroups C plugin for collectd, but it handles only cpuacct values, and doesn't handle patterns.

Debian
------

This plugin is tested with Debian Jessie.

One of your service has to active CPUAccounting :

    [Service]
    CPUAccounting=true

After that, you will see something in the path :

    ls /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/system.slice/
